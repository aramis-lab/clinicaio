    In general, subjects will stay in the scanner during one session. 
    However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room and then be re-positioned 
    on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions will still be considered as a session 
    and match sessions acquired in other subjects. Similarly, in situations where different 
    data types are obtained over several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI 
    the day after) those can be grouped in one session.

    Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar data 
    acquisitions are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the 
    case of some intervention between sessions (for example, training).

    however, the user is free to choose any other label than highres and lowres as long as they are 
    consistent across subjects and sessions.

    In case different sequences are used to record the same modality (for example, RARE and FLASH for T1w) 
    this field can also be used to make that distinction. The level of detail at which the distinction
